💡 Recommended Architecture

1️⃣ Data Warehouse Layer (Storage)
Use: PostgreSQL (local or managed like Supabase) or Google BigQuery.
Store your raw event tables (bets, deposits, sessions) and aggregated features (player_features).

2️⃣ ETL / Feature Engineering Layer

Use Airflow, Prefect, or a simple Python ETL script that aggregates last 30 days’ behavior per player.

This ETL will output a table like player_features_YYYY_MM.

3️⃣ ML Layer

Python pulls data from DB → Pandas DataFrame → model training (scikit-learn, XGBoost).

After training, predictions can be written back to a table like predicted_churns.
